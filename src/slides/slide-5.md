Want what they want, don't understand consequences

_I want ice cream!!!_

that doing bad leads to pain / punishment_

Bargain for what they want, understand consequences, but
only as the downside of a bargain.

_I won't take the ice create without asking,
because I will get in trouble_

* More modern approaches to IT (ITIL)
* Better communication between teams, but still bargaining

_Avoidance of Pain_
