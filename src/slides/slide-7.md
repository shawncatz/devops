# What is Devops?

Acceptance of pain. 

*It is helping the system be an adult*.

* We find the things that are hard or painful and do them *MORE*!
* We talk about how to improve things rather than avoiding the problems.
* We improve the system where it needs it and we measure the results.
* We make it possible to get feedback from the system as quickly as possible.
* We adapt quickly to change - because we see it sooner.
