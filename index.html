# What is Devops?

Not rhetorical.

Asking for examples.

---

# Devops

* Continuous Delivery
* Infrastructure as Code - Solve infrastructure problems with code
* Bridge the gap between IT and Engineering
* Developers learn more about and can help expand infrastructure
* Agile Operations - Agile Methodology applied to Ops
* CAMS - Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing
* Configuration Management - Chef, Puppet, Salt

---

# Patrick Debois and Andrew "Clay" Shafer

* Coined the term Devops
* Made observations about the desire of the community and industry 

## Observations

_really high level_

* there is a increase in feedback loops between business, all parts of the delivery process and operations
* thanks to this feedback loops we increase the quality and speed up the flow

---

# Maturity

* Children
* Adolescents
* Adults

# Maturity - Children

Want what they want, don't understand consequences

_I want ice cream!!!_

* Cowboys
* Close minded
* Old world IT (not following any modern practices)

_Haven't developed value systems, they don't understand
that doing bad leads to pain / punishment_

---
# Maturity - Adolescents

Bargain for what they want, understand consequences, but
only as the downside of a bargain.

_I won't take the ice create without asking,
because I will get in trouble_

* More modern approaches to IT (ITIL)
* Better communication between teams, but still bargaining

_Avoidance of Pain_

---
# Maturity - Adulthood

Understand consequences, make informed decisions. Does
what's right, whether it's hard or not.

_Sometimes I still want ice cream, but I try to avoid
eating it because of my health_

* Devops
* Agile
* Lean

_Acceptance of Pain_

---
# Three Ways

* Underpinning values / principles of Devops
* Popularized by _The Phoenix Project_ and _Devops Handbook_

---
![First Way](img/first-way.png)

* emphasizes the performance of the entire system, 
  as opposed to the performance of a specific silo 
  of work or department 
* focus is on all business value streams that are 
  enabled by IT
  
## Results

* never passing a known defect to downstream work centers
* never allowing local optimization to create global degradation
* always seeking to increase flow
* always seeking to achieve profound understanding of the system

---
![Second Way](img/second-way.png)

* creating the right to left feedback loops
* process improvement initiative => shorten and amplify 
  feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.

## Results

* understanding and responding to all customers - internal and external
* shortening and amplifying all feedback loops
* embedding knowledge where it's needed

---
![Third Way](img/third-way.png)

* creating a culture that fosters two things:
  * continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure
  * understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.

## Results

* allocating time for improvement of daily work
* creating rituals that reward the team for taking risks
* introducing faults into the system to increase resilience

---
# What is Devops?

Acceptance of pain. 

*It is helping the system be an adult*.

* We find the things that are hard or painful and do them *MORE*!
* We talk about how to improve things rather than avoiding the problems.
* We improve the system where it needs it and we measure the results.
* We make it possible to get feedback from the system as quickly as possible.
* We adapt quickly to change - because we see it sooner.

---

# Q & A

* Questions?
* Comments?
* Validations?
* Vilifications?

## Coming soon!

* Tasty Tasty Loops: OODA Loops
